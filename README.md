# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Step 1:
Use the standard libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot in python for the Gradient Descent.

Step 2:
Upload the dataset conditions and check for any null value in the values provided using the .isnull() function.

Step 3:
Declare the default values such as n, m, c, L for the implementation of linear regression using gradient descent.

Step 4:
Calculate the loss using Mean Square Error formula and declare the variables y_pred, dm, dc to find the value of m.

Step 5:
Predict the value of y and also print the values of m and c.

Step 6:
Plot the accquired graph with respect to hours and scores using the scatter plot function.

Step 7:
End the program.


## Program:

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent is written and verified using python programming.
